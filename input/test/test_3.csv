If that isn't enough, when you actually get in, you get told that they're out of brown bread. This was half the reason why we went in the first place. We were also told that they were out of the Louisana chicken pasta but it ended up being false alarm. I'm not sure if it actually was though because the pasta tasted and looked nothing like the original louisana pasta that I've had twice before. It was good, but definitely questionable on whether we were served what we ordered which is ridiculous. We also received our drinks after we finished eating our main course which I found completely unacceptable. These people are so disorganized, needs better management for sure. This review would have been 1 star if it weren't for the food being so good...even if it wasn't what we ordered.","LOUISIANA CHICKEN PASTA,-",,2,LLIaKf8tnvKGPmAy9HAwhg,3,1,1/1,

The buzzer actually worked when I was behind Victoria's Secret. \n\nOther than the fried calamari and Taco shells, everything we got was delicious.  The calamari only had tiny thin tentacles, no rings. When the plate got to us, the plate looked full of calamari, but it was exaggerated by batter and gaps since no ring parts were used.  So felt like we are just eating fried batter. \n\nThe price was rather high.  Affordable and big portion was what we liked from the US restaurants, but here it costed over $30 a person with 1 appetizer and 2 soft drinks. \nPlus, $9 for a slice of cheesecake that isn't that special.  \n\nTheir service was great! \nWill visit again if we don't have to stand in line.\n\nEdit: looked through some photos.

Super cute and spacious restaurant located in the Premium Outlet Mall. The restaurant is very comfortable and is the perfect spot to catch up with your friends, stop by when you get hungry from all the shopping, or when you are craving a piece of cheesecake. They serve anything from fish and seafood, to salads, to sandwiches, to pastas! I always order the Louisiana Chicken Pasta when I'm here and I've been doing that for the past several years. You can't go wrong. They also have a skinny menu if you're trying to be healthy. Cheesecakes here are also a must.

Unfortunately this location did not.\n\nMy boyfriend and I went after a lovely show at the Smith Center and it let out about 10pm. We wanted to go eat somewhere nice and conveniently close. As we love our Cheesecake Factory at Green Valley Ranch, we decided to try this location based on our great experiences with the other locations.\n\nGreat factor was that it was open till 12am but downside is that even though there were not so many people on a Friday night, the service was very slow. We usually get our favorites, Avocado Spring Rolls, Bistro Shrimp Pasta and Rib Eye Steak. \n\nThe Spring rolls were delicious as is the sauce which is easily devoured! But the Bistro Shrimp pasta was really spicy! Now this is supposed to be a general garlic and wine sauce with no spicyiness at all. It had way too much red chili peppers! My mouth was on fire! \n\nThe steak was burned but my boyfriend ate it anyways since he was hungry.\n\nWhen the server asked about the meals I let him know of the issues but all we got was a 'Sorry' (It wasn't his fault for the food though) and only 5% off the bill.\n\nIf you want the traditional Cheesecake Factory yumminess, don't go to this location as it lacks the quality and taste.","BISTRO SHRIMP PASTA,-

I\'m a huge fan of the chain and was excited when a location opened close to my work downtown. At this point, though, I can say my co-workers and I will probably never return to this one again.\n\nWe were a party of 8 and arrived early, so we beat the entire lunch crowd in terms of getting seated and getting our orders in. When we ordered, I asked the waitress for bread and butter. 10 minutes later, we were all sitting around, still waiting for our bread and butter.\n\n45 minutes after we had ordered, our food was still nowhere to be seen. When the food did begin to come out, it came in waves. Eventually, all but one of us had gotten our food. This was bizzarre because three people at the table had ordered salmon. Two got their salmon, the third was left waiting. It was a solid 7 minutes that we all sat around staring at our food as it grew cold while we waited for the final person to get her meal so we could all start eating. \n\nThe manager did come and appologize for this, and gave her a comped dessert, so that was nice. Another person\'s salmon ended up being completely burned on the bottom, so that had to go back and the manager her a comped dessert as well. \n\nWe were there for a celebreation, so when it came time to order dessert, several of us ordered cheesecake. I ordered a slice of the Banana Creme Cheesecake. They brought our cheesecakes, and I took one bite of mine and it was FROZEN. At that point, I was so over it I didn\'t even want to mention it to the waitress, but the rest of my party was fed up and told her as soon as she came over again. She made a face and informed us that the Cheesecakes are all freshly made.\n\nI poked the cheesecake with my fork to demonstrate and it made the classic ""crunch"" sound of a frozen cake, so she took away my cheesecake and was gone for another 10 minutes (this was the trend of the whole meal). When she returned, she asked if I\'d like to have strawberry cheesecake instead. I said no thank you, can I please just have another slice of the banana creme? She then informed me that the banana creme was all frozen. So I ended up with no cheesecake.\n\nAnd all would have been well if that had been the end of it. I\'d have left sad and disappointed, but not angry. No, the anger came when I got the bill and saw that my frozen, inedible, cheesecake that I had been forced to cancel was charged on the bill, and then marked as a ""comp."" Being forced to take back food because it is frozen is not a ""comp, "" that is bad customer service. It is insulting to your customers when you mark food as a ""comp"" when in fact they received nothing. I had one bite of frozen cake and was forced to send it back. You have not done me any favors by not charging me for that cake. That cake should never have been given to me in the first place. \n\nOverall, the main dishes we did receive were the usual yummy quality of Cheesecake Factory. But getting our bread took forever, getting our food took forever, getting our desserts took forever, and getting our bill took forever. There is a serious managment issue going on with this location that needs to be fixed ASAP.","FRESH BANANA CREAM CHEESECAKE,-",,2,I3XJNDCe50zG7ddKDCDqAA,3,1,1/1,

I had never been to a Cheesecake Factory before so I looked at the online menu before we even left.  I wanted to have at least some kind of idea going in.  It did not take me long to choose the Renee Special lunch with a Ceasar Salad, chicken almond salad sandwich and the soup of the day, cream of mushroom.  I was very happy with all of it.  From quality to quantity, it was all enjoyable.  The salad, while a good Ceasar, was nothing special.  Just a salad done right.  The soup was crazy good.  I love mushrooms and mushroom soup. This was an interesting varient that was a littl less creamy than I am used to but loaded with mushrooms, carrots and some other bits of deliciousness.  The sandwich was abotu as good as the soup.  Even though it was chicken salad.  This wasn't the soggy mash of chicken salad your mama used to send you to school with. This was solid chunks of chicken with a bit of mayo and almonds.  It was very good and I would gladly order it again.  My one regret is not ordering a piece of cheesecake.  I love cheesecake and I was at the Cheesecake Factory.  How could I be so careless as to not order cheesecake?  I just have to shrug that off right now and go back again later.  I'll get my cheescake.

This review is specifically aimed for this location.  This was my first time to this property. I came tonight for a birthday party. Now I understand large groups can be challenging but with that being said there were still some awkward moments. I arrived and when I asked for my party the girl at the front just gave me half ass directions. She told me to go through the double doors. The only double doors I saw looked like an exit outside so I just kind of roamed around aimlessly until I was able to stop and ask another employee where to go. So those double doors that led out were correct. So they have doors that go outside first and then there is another set of doors leading to a separate room. But come on.... I know I couldn't have been the first person to be confused by the layout. It wouldn't have killed her to give a little more detail. Our server was nice and personable. I ordered the Louisiana pasta. Tasty but not really memorable. The lady next to me ordered the salmon which she said was fantastic. Two people on opposite ends of the table ordered the shrimp angel hair pasta and they both said the shrimp was WAY over cooked, rubbery and a lot of shell. See no one really checked on how the meal was until we were all almost done. Since it was a birthday my friend was trying to be discreet and let the server know about the dissatisfaction with the shrimp on two dishes. His response was that she should have let him no sooner. And yes... she should have. But no one came by to check. So was she supposed to interrupt dinner to find someone. Again, it was a birthday party and she didn't want to make a scene. Then the check came without offering anyone dessert. Yes.... dessert came for the birthday girl. So that should have been a great time to ask anyone if they would like to finish it off with something sweet. When my check was handed to me I asked for a piece to go and was told I would have to have two separate checks. Ok fine. I guess it's somehow my fault I wasn't offered dessert before the check. 2 bills then. Whatever. Just bring me my cheesecake please....","LOUISIANA CHICKEN PASTA,

The training was extensive and the expectations from our managers were high. If I provided service like the service we receive when we go, I would be fired. \n\nToday was no exception. We went because we had a gift card. Even though the last few times (at other locations), the experience has been similar. Our server was slow, completely uninterested and lackadaisical. It started out semi fine, but turned into sitting and waiting for forever for everything with empty drinks. It's so weird to me to walk by a table over and over and see (or not see) that the drinks are completely empty and never think to refill. I'm allllll for tipping and tipping well, but isn't that what I'm tipping for?! To have a decent experience and be able to have a sip of water during the meal?! We looked around throughout our time there, and all of the server's tables needed their drinks filled, orders taken or food boxed up. But he was no where to be found. \n\nWe ordered the tuna poke entree. The presentation was beautiful as always. But the rice was dry (and wayyyyy too much of it), there was verryyyyyy little siracha aioli, and it was really bland over all. To give an example how bland- I shared it with my 9 month old baby. Especially for $15.95. I could get a delicious sushi burrito bowl with good quality fish and amazing toppings and fresh rice for $9 at a lot of places in Vegas now!\n\nWe also ordered the Shrimp with angel hair which was good and pasta cooked well and the crispy chicken costoletta. That was yummy too and came out with the side of sauce my husband had asked for. \n\nWe have such special memories of the Cheesecake Factory because of our history there.  We opened and worked in so many of the stores. It's such a disappointment to go and get such poor service when you know it's really not that hard and you can make good money when you provide a good experience. So we've gone back for the history. But its the service that usually makes you walk out feeling like you just wasted your money and time :(","TUNA POKE,-

Only downfall was that they had ran out of white rice, so they gave him brown rice. \nFor dessert we had the red velvet cheesecake....eh I do not like red velvet so I am not even going to review this dessert.

This should have been called ""Breaded Shrimp and Cream Sauce."" \n\nAnyways the mashed potatoes were good but I wanted gravy. The Herb Crusted Salmon was alright. I didn\'t really like the crust, a bit too bitter for my taste. The breaded shrimp was good and the cream sauce was fine.

Regardless it was a chill atmosphere, and the dessert was good. The whole place has soft music playing but feels very loud and is hard to talk while in there, not sure if it was the 3 other tables of people or just the architectural design of the place producing a lot of echo/feedback.

There was a lot of activity there on this particular day because everyone realized at the last minute that today was the last day for half price cheesecake.  \nOur waitress was sweet and kinda adorable too with her positive approach, bringing me water without asking, and helping to select menu options for hubby and myself.  I couldn\'t decide on dinner and asked for her to give me a recommendation.  \nI went with a salad, I think it was their version of an Asian salad but truly I just can\'t remember.  I had asked if there was a salad with strawberries and chicken and what she suggested is the one I had, but she got the kitchen to add strawberries so it was more to my liking.  Excellent.\nAnd hubbies pasta was served up as he had requested too.  Very nice.\nFrench fries that were supposed to be part of my sons meal were overlooked and didn\'t make it to the table until he was almost done with his sandwich.\nAnd the manager actually stopped by to apologize for the French fry oversight too.\nHere we were enjoying each others company and the food, discussing the day and such -not at all in a fuss about the overlooked FF, so it was a surprise to have him check in on us.\nIt seems the spicy chicken sandwich he ordered was not what he had hoped for because it didn\'t have enough spice to really qualify as ""spicy"", but otherwise he said it was good.\nNow the cheesecakes, omg, there are so many options it\'s difficult to decide.\nI went with my first impression and got the Mango and Key Lime.  Not being a fan of Key Lime pie I wasn\'t so thrilled with that part but thought the Mango might make the Key Lime a nice blend.  Eh, not the case.  I felt I was eating a Key Lime with Mango cheesecake.\nStill good and after a couple bites with some coffee I decided I should have the rest packed up and it was time to go.\n\nPrompt seating even through there was a huge crowd.\nReally good service, but the times I\'ve been here before I guess this is standard and to be expected.\nYummy meal that was ordered up with specific instructions and delivered as such.","MANGO KEY LIME CHEESECAKE, +",,4,quH7oYf3C-_klKjP-cklCQ,3,,,

The food looked and tasted great, and the service was good and quick for a weekend lunch. \n\nI ordered a BBQ burger cooked medium rare with fries and my fianc\xc3\xa9e ordered a Cuban sandwich. Both were bigger than expected and cooked as ordered. \n\nThe menu at Cheesecake Factory is huge and there were lots of entrees I wanted to try. I even scoped out other tables to see how their food looked at it was all awesome!","CUBAN SANDWICH, +",,5,97cxZHHa2K2yfmIRc4hEPw,3,,,

The wait wasn\'t bad at all, maybe ten minutes tops. After being seated we were provided the complimentary bread & water. We both opted to trying a mixed drink off the menu: Whiskey Smash & the Ultimate Margarita. The Smash wasn\'t terrible, had decent flavor but did taste a little watered down after a few sips. The Margarita, however, was terrible- tasted purely of margarita mix & nothing else; pretty much had to force it down- no sense in wasting a $10 drink. We also ordered the Corn Tamale Cakes as an appetizer. These were kinda weird; flavor was more sweet than anything. There are 3 cakes to a plate, I barely finished one and we didn\'t even touch the third.\n\nOur visit thus far was mediocre, but we decided to still order entrees. I ordered the Shrimp & Chicken  Gumbo which was no gumbo at all. I grew up eating gumbo & have always known it to have a broth to make it almost like a soup; this was just gloopy and mush. There was absolutely no flavor, the shrimp was overcooked & extremely chewy and the rice was still hard. I took a few bites and couldn\'t force anymore down. It was gross. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Shrimp with Angel Hair. The description talks about all this lemon, garlic flavor with some marinara sauce. This ""meal"" had absolutely no flavoring. It seemed like they made the pasta, threw a hefty helping of bruschetta tomatoes on top and threw on 5 pieces of overcooked shrimp to it & charged us $17.95. There was no sauce, no lemon/herb flavor. My boyfriend took 2 bites and pushed it to the side. It was terrible. \n\nWe immediately asked for our check & our server didn\'t even ask if everything was alright or if there was anything she could do. Nope, she just dropped our check off and that was that, even after seeing the full plates of food still. An $89 meal that was beyond basic and left us both feeling disappointed, frustrated and hungry.","SWEET CORN TAMALE CAKES, -

Their happy hour is from 4-6pm mon-fri. \n\nThey gave me a regular menu so I had to specifically ask for a happy hour menu which I feel should be given automatically during happy hour along w the regular menu. Orrr at least ask if I\'d like the happy hour menu. \n\nFor happy hour some Drinks $5.95, some apps $5.95 and small plates range from $5.95-9 give or take. \n\nI got the JW Pink Lemonade. Which is my absolute absolute favorite drink. Soo delicious, perfect blend of sweet and tart. But the calories would make me sway away from it if I have never had it or if I\'m watching my caloric intake, but it was a long day so I\'m my head i said ""treat yo self""\n\nFor food I got the sausage ricotta flatbread. It has sausage, ricotta, herbs, kale, and mozz(I believe). Tastes good, smaller than I hoped but it was good. \n\nService was alright. They asked if I wanted bread, said yes but they forgot. Prob didn\'t need the extra calories but I did want it. \n\nAlso don\'t ask them for recommendations. They always say everything ""is good just depends what you like"". Feel like they aren\'t honest. Just saying that whatever you ask about tastes good. Would like an honest opinions but guess that\'s their job.","LEMON-RICOTTA PANCAKES, -",,3,98F1MRVrJP4WefdFTIVjTA,3,,,
