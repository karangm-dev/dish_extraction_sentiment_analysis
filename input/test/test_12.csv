We had too much stuff on our table and my full glass of wine fell, to which the immediately came and cleaned it up and replaced it (free of charge) which I was not expecting.\n\nI got the chicken tacos and my friend got the chicken enchiladas.\n\nThe chicken in my tacos were dry, and my friend just got back from Mexico didn't enjoy their food either. It was very bland.\n\nMy honest advice would be to just wait in the front for the individually sliced cheesecake. Beats having to eat unflavoured food.","WINE,+

First off let me immediately shout out Kevin for being nothing less than awesome. Overall a 3, I'll throw a 5 in to the equation for how they handled their crappy Sunday services. 4 for how the food was because it was just fine. We show up on Easter with no wait and last minute plans so I was pleasantly surprised to find and get a perfect outdoor patio table immediately for 4, at 11:00 and then... no one shows up for a solid 10 minutes for drinks or anything. There's 3 other tables patiently waiting with us so I finally go to get someone when a manager sees me coming. She says someone will be right there which ended up being her and another manager...so Cecil(I believe?) comes over super polite and takes our order, drink and food. Food comes out and the order is wrong. I tell the girl we ordered the brioche French toast and she starts to walk away,  I say we can keep this one(the child's brunch) it's fine she says hold on and I say uhh ok or you can walk away while I'm speaking to you (yes I'm a little feisty now) she comes back and says I was just checking the order I said yeah and walked away right when I was speaking which was super rude. Fast forward to Kevin, he hears my comments, comes over, and takes our table right away from there on out it was perfect! I must've made a stir  because the original manager came over and ended our service with 3 complimentary cheesecakes and a brioche French toast on them. I am impressed that they took responsibility for their slacking but man they really could've saved like $40 with their better communication skills and personable etiquette(cough cough server girl) I'm serious that if/when I go back I'll ask for Kevin because I could be wrong but I don't think he had responsibility for us and really stepped up.","""BRIOCHE BREAKFAST SANDWICH"", ""BRULÉED FRENCH TOAST""","Okay so this review is all over the place, bare with me.

We came here Sunday branch and ordered a monte cristo and burlee French toast with a side of bacon. The food took awhile to prepare but the staff made it more enduring to wait. We got a refill of the wheat bread and butter. \nFor those of you who have been to the premium oUtlet in LV, Cheesecake Factory is a nice addition and hangout place while waiting for diehard shoppers.","MONTE CRISTO SANDWICH,
