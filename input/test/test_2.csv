The food was delicious and it was a good portion size, but really expensive!! Usually ordering some tacos at any other restaurant wouldn't be more than $15 -- but at the Cheesecake Factory basically every menu item is $20+. Plus the one slice of cheesecake I had for dessert was an extra $10 (ouch). In the end I ended up spending roughly $35 for dinner with tax and tips.\n\nThe food was definitely good, but not worth the price or the 3 hour wait. I know everyone wants to experience the cheesecake factory for themselves, regardless of the wait times and prices -- so my advice would be to bring a laptop or predownload some shows ahead of time on your phone. You'll thank me later.","FISH TACOS,+

Would recommend trying to get there right when they first open (we were there at 11am on a Sunday morning) to get a seat. I have heard/read that wait times can be up to a few hours during peak times.\n\nOverall, our experience was very good. We were seated in a cozy booth for two by the window which was nice (always love good lighting for food pics!) and our server was so sweet. If you have been to an outpost of The Cheesecake Factory in the States, you will notice the interior is almost exactly the same.\n\nWe ended up ordering off of their weekend brunch menu. Food did take a long time (longer than it probably should have) but we were enjoying our coffees and not in a rush, so wasn't a huge deal for us. Our server did come over and check in with us to apologize for the wait.\n\nFor my main, I opted for the huevos rancheros and bae got the breakfast burrito (not sure if that is the exact name for it lol). Both brunch meals were tasty and put together nicely. My eggs were cooked perfectly and the pico de gallo salsa was really delicious. I also enjoyed the slight kick from the ranchero sauce on top of the dish. Bae said he liked his main and couldn't finish the last couple of bites - it was huge!!\n\nWe obviously HAD to try a slice of cheesecake on our first visit but had a really hard time deciding on which piece - many of them sounded so tasty. Our server recommended the hazelnut crunch to us and we were very happy with our selection. If you are a fan of Ferrero Rocher candies, this would be the cheesecake for you.\n\nAs others have pointed out, unless you want to stuff yourself, consider sharing a piece of the cheesecake. Our slice was huge plus super decadent but really really tasty. The top layer of the cake was nutella, with hazelnut cheesecake batter underneath which was laced with crispy crunchy chunks of hazelnut cookie (?). Oh so good!! Even with the two of us sharing, we couldn't finish the whole thing so took the rest to go.\n\nSadly, about 15 minutes after we left we realized in a panic that we left our leftover cheesecake behind. OH NOOOOO!!! We ran back to see if it was still there on our table by some miracle but of course it was gone. We found our server and she surprised us by coming back with a brand new slice for us to take home. Such a lovely gesture, it was so appreciated!\n\nLooking forward to coming back someday soon, hopefully the lines will have died down a bit by then ;)","FACTORY HUEVOS RANCHEROS,+

We waiting in the mall line for 20 mins and then another 2 hours almost for the pager to ring. Knowing how busy the restaurant, I had expected a wait but I did not appreciate the front desk hostess poor customer service. She was not very helpful at all and displayed poor attitude towards customers. When we were finally sat down, we also ended up getting a spot really close to the emergency exit which was super chilly. Honestly, this was about to be a 2-star review easily but the food was good and our waitress was a gem. My boyfriend ordered his favourite combo plate (madera chicken and steak) and I ordered myself the shrimp scampi. Both dishes were delicious. My complaint about my dish was that there wasn't a lot of angel hair pasta but a fair amount of shrimps. For dessert, we ordered the chocolate hazelnut cheesecake and it was delicious!!!

There's very long lineups in the mall just to get an alarm coaster to tell you that it's your time to dine. The lineups used to be more more than three hours but after two months in operations(and efficiency) your wait time is a bit over two hours now even on a Saturday. Tip: lineup starts infront of Victoria Secret store. Lineup from  inside don't go through their main doors since you'll be eventually redirected to that lineup in the mall. It will save you a good 10-20 minutes of trying to find the real lineup. The good: very family oriented with over 200 different meals. We got red wine, of course, with my bow  tie pesto meal and sea food angel hair pasta Bolognese. You don't leave  here without getting their  cheesecake- we tried salted caramel and raspberry. The bad: The wait.The ugly: these cakes cost nearly $10 a slice!! Some meals offer lunch or dinner portions(which are larger portions).you pay for atmosphere.

Too few pieces of pecans and goat cheese. The dressing had too much vinegar and too little oil. I ordered the steak medallion instead of the steak Diane off the skinnylicious menu. The serving was too small and again too too much salt. I was done after two bites. I tried my daughters buffalo chicken appetizer. Again too salty. She had a side of the buffalo sauce.

I guess everything really IS bigger in Texas, huh?\n\nThe fish and chips received rave reviews as did the chicken and biscuits. My mom really loved the gravy that came with it. The food itself gets four stars but I can't get over the wait time after ordering your food. That plays a big part especially if you're on a time crunch.","fish and chips,+

Good thing we decided to share everything because their portions are no joke.  We enjoyed everything we ordered.\n\nService was pleasant and our food arrived in a timely manner.  Our only complaint was that the air conditioner was probably set to 40 degrees or something since it was 90+ degrees out and the temperature difference was so drastic that it made it hard to enjoy the environment.","SHRIMP WITH ANGEL HAIR"",+",,4,Bbar1EB4JEviStEAqUEFOg,"3,2",1,1/2,

Good timing, too. We had a couple gift cards to use. \n\nSo, we came here on saturday for lunch, way before the crowd; since we got a tip from one of the ladies here to get in here before 12:15 pm as we were checking out the menu posted outside. \n\nWe had the complimentary bread basket  with butter (french baguette slices and pumpernickel slices) and our little man had one too, which also included sliced bananas. I had a bunch of questions about the menu, since it'd been a while. I opted for the lunch size asian salad, while hubby had his favorite item, the cuban sandwich, and our little man had the mini corndogs and fries. It was delicious. I couldn't finish my salad, which was pretty big, even for the lunch size, but I'm glad I asked about the size of the salad. We also got dessert, once I mentioned the crazy one, hubby wanted that one. It was really good, too. I just was stuffed. (We had leftovers.) We still had a balance on one of the gift cards. They are treated as credit cards, so you still have to sign them. \n\nThe service was excellent- our server was pretty attentive (drink refills, and checking on us from time to time). And the other servers were nice and smiling, as they passed us, too. It's refreshing to see people in customer service who want to be there, who enjoy their jobs.   \n\nInside, the decor (barqoue/neo-classical- elegant), was very in line with their other restaurants (been to Forum/Summerlin/Green Valley). We had to switch seats (booth & tables seating is available) as the TV had hubby's game that he was DVR'ing. Our stoller was stored with the rest, elsewhere. The lady gave us a claim ticket. \n\nBathrooms were near the entrance. There were mens, womens, and a family one. I went into the womens and there were two stalls, one was handicapped. I went into the smaller one so I don't know if there was a baby changing station in the handicapped stall. \n\nThe food court at this Premium Outlets is really lacking (Ok, who am I kidding, it sucks!), so this restaurant is going to be very busy and popular (the huge menu and the huge selection of cheesecake flavors). Hubby mentioned that this could be one of our special occasion restaurants. Our first date was at the one at Forum Shops (back in 2004). So, yes, we will be back.

Came with a creamy lemon sauce, asparagus and mashed potatoes. For the second thing I got their steak diane. I forgot how it tasted and I was craving mushrooms so decided to get it. Let's just say that I did not enjoy it, as I thought I would. \nWe had some buffalo chicken strips that were really good. \nAnd my boyfriend had their jambalaya with shrimp, sausage and not sure what else but it was tasty. Packed with a lot of flavor. Only downfall was that they had ran out of white rice, so they gave him brown rice. \nFor dessert we had the red velvet cheesecake....eh I do not like red velvet so I am not even going to review this dessert. All I can say is, it was a huge slice. \n\nAs we were finishing dinner, they brought out a little ice cream sundae for my mom, as they sang Happy Birthday.
