So we decided to get takeout instead, we got different cheesecakes: Key lime, snickers, tiramisu, original, Anniversary and chocolate. The coffee took the longest to get. Overall the cheesecake is pretty good, visiting the Cheesecake Factory is more of a novelty.","TIRAMISU,+

We arrived around 12:48 PM and we were led to a table right away. It wasn't extremely busy but most tables were occupied. I ordered a hot cafe mocha, spicy chicken chipotle pasta (lunch special), and a white chocolate raspberry truffle. We were also served with complimentary breadsticks. They were warm and were great to munch on before our meal. \n\nThe cafe mocha was large but nothing too spectacular regarding the flavour. It was a standard mocha. The spicy chicken chipotle pasta smelled delicious when it arrived. I also added some Parmesan cheese on top. The crispy tortilla chips added an extra crunch to the dish and I enjoyed it. The spicy chicken was flavourful, and had a nice kick. There were also pieces of asparagus and green peas to add a little green to the dish. However, I thought the pasta itself were too firm, it would have been better if they were softer. \n\nI took a long time to decide which cheesecake to get because they just had so many! After much contemplation, I settled for the white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake. It was a big slice with whipped cream on top and on the side. It was truly delightful, it wasn't too sweet which I liked. At first I was worried that it would be too sweet but not at all. The cheesecake itself was smooth and creamy, with a great balance between the white chocolate and raspberry. I cannot wait to try their other cheesecake next time I'm in the States.\n\nService was great, the server dropped by to check up on us and made sure everything was good. Food arrived in a timely manner. I asked for a to-go cup for my mocha and I received one promptly. Overall, I had a great experience at the Cheesecake Factory.","CAFÃ‰ MOCHA,
