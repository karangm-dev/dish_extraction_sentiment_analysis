So notoriously famous for being one of the most anticipated American chain restaurants to arrive in Toronto. \n\nCame on a weekday evening and there was about a 20 min wait. The wait times are very variable - at lunch I've heard there's a 5-10 min wait - dinner on a weekend an hour perhaps? The good thing is you can get a pager and walk around Yorkdale in the meantime. \n\nI was really looking forward to this meal because of the hype surrounding it, but I have mixed feelings. The menu is extremely extensive, there's something for everyone! Vegetarian, seafood, pasta, meat lover etc - you'll find something you want. Decided on cheese sticks as a app, fish tacos as a main and of course raspberry white chocolate cheesecake for dessert. I mean how could I not have cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory? \n\nThe service was attentive and friendly although the restaurant was busy. \n\nThe cheese sticks I wasn't a huge fan of - good portion size but the flavour was a bit off to me. The fish tacos were fresh and flavourful and came with plenty of sides. Good portions for the mains for sure. The cheesecake was definitely a winner - so delicious! I was so stuffed after my meal. \n\nThere's definitely value in the meal, but it is on the pricey side. Plus the wait times and loud ambience decrease the rating for me. If you want just the cheesecake (which in my opinion is the best things on the menu) Vaughan Mills has a kiosk which sells the cheesecake for cheaper (and no line).","FISH TACOS,+

Would recommend trying to get there right when they first open (we were there at 11am on a Sunday morning) to get a seat. I have heard/read that wait times can be up to a few hours during peak times.\n\nOverall, our experience was very good. We were seated in a cozy booth for two by the window which was nice (always love good lighting for food pics!) and our server was so sweet. If you have been to an outpost of The Cheesecake Factory in the States, you will notice the interior is almost exactly the same.\n\nWe ended up ordering off of their weekend brunch menu. Food did take a long time (longer than it probably should have) but we were enjoying our coffees and not in a rush, so wasn't a huge deal for us. Our server did come over and check in with us to apologize for the wait.\n\nFor my main, I opted for the huevos rancheros and bae got the breakfast burrito (not sure if that is the exact name for it lol). Both brunch meals were tasty and put together nicely. My eggs were cooked perfectly and the pico de gallo salsa was really delicious. I also enjoyed the slight kick from the ranchero sauce on top of the dish. Bae said he liked his main and couldn't finish the last couple of bites - it was huge!!\n\nWe obviously HAD to try a slice of cheesecake on our first visit but had a really hard time deciding on which piece - many of them sounded so tasty. Our server recommended the hazelnut crunch to us and we were very happy with our selection. If you are a fan of Ferrero Rocher candies, this would be the cheesecake for you.\n\nAs others have pointed out, unless you want to stuff yourself, consider sharing a piece of the cheesecake. Our slice was huge plus super decadent but really really tasty. The top layer of the cake was nutella, with hazelnut cheesecake batter underneath which was laced with crispy crunchy chunks of hazelnut cookie (?). Oh so good!! Even with the two of us sharing, we couldn't finish the whole thing so took the rest to go.\n\nSadly, about 15 minutes after we left we realized in a panic that we left our leftover cheesecake behind. OH NOOOOO!!! We ran back to see if it was still there on our table by some miracle but of course it was gone. We found our server and she surprised us by coming back with a brand new slice for us to take home. Such a lovely gesture, it was so appreciated!\n\nLooking forward to coming back someday soon, hopefully the lines will have died down a bit by then ;)","FACTORY HUEVOS RANCHEROS,+

As a note, there are long lines, but this is fairly normal at all their locations. This is not a Toronto thing. The lines will probably get shorter over time, but they'll never go away. \n\nThe entire restaurant, including the food, is exactly like the US versions. The only difference, of course, is price. They've obviously upped the prices for the Canadian dollar. \n\nThe Yorkdale location is pretty big, but I have seen bigger Cheesecake Factory's in the US. The bar area could be a wee bigger, but it's okay. The takeout area could also use more space because it's right near the entrance where people are waiting. But the layout is otherwise fine. It is confusing, however, because they have both an outside entrance and a mall entrance. My friend and I entered via the outside entrance but had to go sign in at the mall entrance. There were no signs about this, which would have been helpful. And since the whole wait list is electronic, it doesn't make sense why people couldn't signup at either entrance. \n\nThe food was good. The drinks a decent size, but pop is always over priced at restaurants. The food portions are massive, which is a tradition at the Cheesecake Factory. And the menu selection is massive, so be prepared to have to debate yourself over what you want. \n\nAnd the cheesecake, what can you say about perfection?! I ordered a slice of the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake for dessert but also took home a small strawberry cheesecake. The slices are an okay price, but the full sized cakes are expensive. And they should probably provide some storage instructions for take home cheesecakes. \n\nOverall, I would recommend a visit, at least once. If you live near there, you can easily do takeout if you don't want to wait. And you can takeout a cheesecake anytime too.","CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE - DOUGH CHEESECAKE,+

I got here around 11am and there was so line at all. \n\nI got the chicken and waffles with poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. Though the chicken and waffles were good, the poached eggs were overcooked and the hollandaise sauce def wasn't the best I've had. But I will say that the side of potatoes were pretty darn good. \n\nI also got the white chooclate macadamia nut cheesecake and I love cheesecake, so I was def a fan. \n\nThe service was really good tho!

But I was disappointed after waiting for an hour for takeout, not including waiting for a cashier to take my order. \n\nI ordered the carbonara and two cheesecakes: tiramisu and the banana cream. The carbonara was nothing special. And it was 20 dollars, not worth it in my opinion. The cheesecakes were both light, not too sweet and it was smooth. But it didn't amaze me and they were 10 dollar for each. \n\nService: Not impressed. They told me to come back 30 minutes for the food which I did and the food was not ready. I waited a whole hour for it. And the pasta was cold. Also, when I show the guy my receipt to pick up my food, he just took it and then went on to help other customers without telling me what is going on. It was after 10 minutes of me trying to get his attention that he told me that the food wasn't ready yet. He should've told me that instead of ignoring me.","PASTA CARBONARA,-

We were seated right away even thought the restaurant looked quite busy. The service was not bad. The girl at the front was rude but our actual server was extremely nice. She was on top of refills when needed, which is nice since it was a hot day.\n\nWe ordered small things, like the fried cheese sticks, southern fried crispy chicken sliders and the Nashville hot chicken nuggets. My husband said the sliders were good, they were pretty tasty. One thing I noticed is they put the lettuce, tomatoes and pickles on the side so you can assemble your own slider. My Nashville hot chicken was alright. It wasn't true Nashville hot chicken but I appreciate that effort of trying. I'm just glad it wasn't just Franks red hot sauce. The fried cheese was delicious! I would order it again. \n\nNow on to the dessert because thats why everyone comes here right? I ordered the cookie dough cheesecake and it was very rich and delicious. It was to sweet near the end and I was unable to finish it though. My husband ordered the lemon raspberry cream cheesecake. He said it was very refreshing, tasty and tart.\n\nAll in all, I would come here again. I found the bill to be a little on the pricey side for the food but you mostly come here to try the different cheesecakes anyways.","CRISPY FRIED CHEESE,+
