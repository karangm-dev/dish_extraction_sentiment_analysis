We arrived around 12:48 PM and we were led to a table right away. It wasn't extremely busy but most tables were occupied. I ordered a hot cafe mocha, spicy chicken chipotle pasta (lunch special), and a white chocolate raspberry truffle. We were also served with complimentary breadsticks. They were warm and were great to munch on before our meal. \n\nThe cafe mocha was large but nothing too spectacular regarding the flavour. It was a standard mocha. The spicy chicken chipotle pasta smelled delicious when it arrived. I also added some Parmesan cheese on top. The crispy tortilla chips added an extra crunch to the dish and I enjoyed it. The spicy chicken was flavourful, and had a nice kick. There were also pieces of asparagus and green peas to add a little green to the dish. However, I thought the pasta itself were too firm, it would have been better if they were softer. \n\nI took a long time to decide which cheesecake to get because they just had so many! After much contemplation, I settled for the white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake. It was a big slice with whipped cream on top and on the side. It was truly delightful, it wasn't too sweet which I liked. At first I was worried that it would be too sweet but not at all. The cheesecake itself was smooth and creamy, with a great balance between the white chocolate and raspberry. I cannot wait to try their other cheesecake next time I'm in the States.\n\nService was great, the server dropped by to check up on us and made sure everything was good.

But, I was meeting with a former coworker and dear friend who had her perfect baby girl almost two months ago and she needed to get out of the house, so it was a date. She was running late so I ordered the ahi tartare, which is served over chopped avocados and soy sauce. This was very good, and helped to curb my appetite until she arrived. I ordered the lunch pizza, which comes with a salad. I try to go for a white pizza because red sauce some times tends to disagree with me. A pretty good pizza. The salad was fine as far as salads go, but the shredded carrots and cucumbers proved to be messy and I ended up with enough salad on my lap to feed a family of rabbits. Seriously, normally I'm not nearly as messy.\n\nHeather, our server, was great!

(Believe me, I've tried.)\n\nSince we were there during happy hour, we decided to share the Spicy Ahi Tuna Tempura Roll and she wanted the HH caesar salad.  The ahi tuna roll and the salad came out fairly quick, and no wonder, since the roll only consisted of four tiny pieces!  We were hungry, and the pieces were so diminutive, that I didn't even get a chance to take a photo of the dish!  It was very tasty, but certainly not substantial, so I took another look at the HH menu and settled on the hummus.  While waiting for it to arrive, Mom and I shared the nicely-sized caesar salad, which was crisp-fresh and not overly-dressed.  \n\nWe decided to hold off on the salad for awhile, so as not to fill ourselves up on it.  The hummus and grilled pita bread arrivedl, and they too were flavorful; We couldn't get enough!  While we normally would've stuck w/ the happy hour menu, Mom had caught sight of a neighboring table's two platters and admired one of them, so I decided to order not the one she thought looked appetizing (the menu description turned her off), but what I had originally wanted to order instead of the hummus plate- a chicken pasta dish from the seasonal menu.  Two chicken breasts, pounded thin, battered, then fried, sitting atop of spaghetti w/ a basil-pesto cream sauce.  On top of the chicken were slices of prosciutto and dressed arugula greens sprinkled w/ grated parmesan.  This dish tasted fabulous, and the different textures it offered made me swoon!  (I knew Mom enjoyed it as well, for she repeated at least two times how great the food was!)  However, I knew that the greasiness of this dish would haunt me after.  Still, a great savory dish, and next time, I'll just skip the happy hour menu (save the caesar salad, that's a must!) and order from the dinner menu, instead.\n\nGreat service, as always, although I just remembered that the honey wheat bread I had asked for arrived stale.  Funny that the server had even bothered to serve it, as she did warn us that it wasn't as fresh as it could be and that a new batch was baking in the oven.  Why even bring stale, hardened bread to the table?  It's the reason why I downgraded from the previous four-star rating to a three...",,,3,M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA,"4, 7",,,
