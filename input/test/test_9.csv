The training was extensive and the expectations from our managers were high. If I provided service like the service we receive when we go, I would be fired. \n\nToday was no exception. We went because we had a gift card. Even though the last few times (at other locations), the experience has been similar. Our server was slow, completely uninterested and lackadaisical. It started out semi fine, but turned into sitting and waiting for forever for everything with empty drinks. It's so weird to me to walk by a table over and over and see (or not see) that the drinks are completely empty and never think to refill. I'm allllll for tipping and tipping well, but isn't that what I'm tipping for?! To have a decent experience and be able to have a sip of water during the meal?! We looked around throughout our time there, and all of the server's tables needed their drinks filled, orders taken or food boxed up. But he was no where to be found. \n\nWe ordered the tuna poke entree. The presentation was beautiful as always. But the rice was dry (and wayyyyy too much of it), there was verryyyyyy little siracha aioli, and it was really bland over all. To give an example how bland- I shared it with my 9 month old baby. Especially for $15.95. I could get a delicious sushi burrito bowl with good quality fish and amazing toppings and fresh rice for $9 at a lot of places in Vegas now!\n\nWe also ordered the Shrimp with angel hair which was good and pasta cooked well and the crispy chicken costoletta. That was yummy too and came out with the side of sauce my husband had asked for. \n\nWe have such special memories of the Cheesecake Factory because of our history there.  We opened and worked in so many of the stores. It's such a disappointment to go and get such poor service when you know it's really not that hard and you can make good money when you provide a good experience. So we've gone back for the history. But its the service that usually makes you walk out feeling like you just wasted your money and time :(","TUNA POKE,-
