You know it, it is a chain and has all the normal stuff that taste, well, like most other places.\n\nSomething exciting about this place is that it is a really cool place to get desserts for your friends and entertainment. Not just cheesecakes. I haven't bought a cheesecake yet. \n\nI am talking about LInda's Fudge Cake, the Tiramisu, the Black Out Cake. These are huge cakes, and very, very good. You just need a full day to let them thaw out as they keep them in the freezer.\n\nVery good, very decadent, and very fun to share.  Try it.",,"All the reviews on the food are pretty accurate.
