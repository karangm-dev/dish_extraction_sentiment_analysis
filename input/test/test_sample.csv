I waited patiently for 2hrs in the 2hrs I asked him once more to check he said he made an announcement and that's all he could do. Another employee saw me there for so long and asked if I needed help. 2 mins later the same manager approaches me and tells me that he can't go around asking all his employees that match the description I gave him and at this point I was being a distraction. I explained it was my car key and I can't leave without it and he said there is nothing he can do. I went to the security office and they had to pull it up on camera walk me across the entire mall and tell another mangager that it was given to an employee on camera and voila the 2nd manager finds my key in under 2 minutes. The 1st manager clearly didn't have the time or patience to deal with my issue. He has a very impatient demeanour and an extreme lack of empathy for absolutely no reason. People like him should be in a position of authority. He was the most unpleasant manager I have ever had to deal with and I wouldn't spend 1$ in the establishment while someone like that is employed.,,,1,9LWvQ1vEE1djTeyxiXUaGg,,,,,

The price is on the stiff side for the quality of the food you get.
