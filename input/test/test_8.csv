Waiting 3 hours on weekday for food like that is not worth it.  If I could wait 1 hour,  I might think about it. \nThe cheese cakes are the worse thing that we had.  Maybe our expectation is a little bit too high.  However,  it only looks good.  The Lemon Meringue is horrible.  It is too sour and not worth 10$ for a slice like that.  My friend had the 30th anniversary cheesecake.  It is too rich that none of us like it.  He couldn't finish it.   \nMy other friend had the fresh strawberry one.  The berries is sweet.  However,  the cake isn't rich enough and way too sweet.  Even though that is original cake with strawberry. The only cheese cake that saved the day is Dulce De Leche. In my opinion, I rather have cheesecake in Costco. \nIt is good to have experienced it.  but not worth it to come back and wait 3 hours for it","LEMON MERINGUE CHEESECAKE,-

The wait line of course is horrible for a Tuesday (1hr 20 mins) after 1pm so i do really recommend everyone to wait until the hype die down a bit before making a visit. \nAppetizers we picked tuna tartare and crab cake bites. Both portion were actually smaller than we thought but it did fill up. \nThe tuna tartare has a balanced flavours of soy and ginger, the avocado chunk at the base separately from the fish make the dish presentable. The chips were a bit too oily. \nThe crab cake bites came with 6 pieces, mayo and lemon wedge on the side. I Expected it to be more crunchy.  theres a decent amount of crab in the little bites which is worth it. \nJambalaya pasta with shrimp and chicken came in huge portion with a mixed of regular pasta and spinach pasta. I like my pasta more al dente tho. Pasta wasn't rinse thoroughly so it was clumped a bit. Sauce was well seasoned, no complaints. \nAlmond crusted salmon salad served with kale, quinoa, dried cranberry and dressed in light sweetened balsamic. Salmon skin is crispy and the crusted is not too heavy which makes the dish overall not bad \nTiramisu cheesecake is amazing. The cheesecake part is not dense, more of a mouse texture which makes it light and not so rich to indulge the whole thing. Base is sponge(lady finger) cake soaked w coffee or kahlua just like a regular tiramisu, two of my fave desserts combine into one make so much sense, i do enjoy it !","AHI TARTARE,+

It was just me and my friend so we got paged after an 1 1/2 even though we were told it be two hours. Apparently according to our sever, the only workaround this is to arrive right at opening time because after lunch time the place remains packed. \n\nThe appetizers (Chicken Taquitos & Loaded Baker Potato Tots) were okay. They came in smaller proportions as compared to other menu items and were alright. \n\nThe main's (Pasta Napoletena and Farfelle with Chicken and Garlic) were super underwhelming. I have had better pasta at other restaurants. Definitely do not recommend these items, it sounds much better than it tastes.\n\nFor dessert, we had Linda's Fudge Cake. It was very delicious although because it is so rich, I would recommend ordering a hot water with lemon drink to cut down on the heaviness.","CHICKEN TAQUITOS,+

I'm not sure if it looks like the USA store as this would have been my first visit ever.  We got a nice booth and started to dive into the 20 page menu! The choice is overwhelming. The staff was great at suggesting items once you narrow it down to a few things. \n\nWe both knew there was going to be huge portions so we decided to skip the appetizers and go straight for the meal. \n\nI decided on the Crispy Chicken Costoletta. It was 3 huge lightly battered and fried chicken breasts with a lemon sauce, mashed potatoes and asparagus. There was enough food for two!  The chicken was cooked perfectly and super tender and very tasty. The lemon sauce kept the whole dish nice and light it added a nice tartness to the dish. The mashed potatoes were great. Super creamy and they left the skin on which is a nice touch. \n\nMy wife had the Chicken Madeira. It was saut\xc3\xa9ed chicken breast with melted mozzarella cheese covered in a fresh mushroom Madeira sauce and topped with asparagus. It also came with a side of mashed potatoes. The Madeira sauce was a slightly sweet wine reduction. The chicken here again was super tender and the sweet sauce gave it a nice flavour. There was plenty of melted cheese! \n\nWe had to squeeze in a slice of cheesecake. We couldn't come all the way here and not get a slice.  We decided to share a slice of Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake. All I can say was wow! It's a very rich piece of cheesecake. I'm glad we decided to share a slice. There is no way I could have eaten a slice on my own. \n\nThe portion sizes are huge here. Everything was great and it was exciting to see all the dishes people were ordering while we were waiting or our food. We will definitely be back. There is pretty much something for everyone at The Cheesecake Factory.","CRISPY CHICKEN COSTOLETTA,+

I have been to the Cheesecake Factory in Buffalo multiple times so I had high standards for my meal.\n\nIn order to get seated at this restaurant you need to be strategic. We arrived at Yorkdale at around 3:20 and immediately we joined the line for a pager. The line was past the Victoria secret entrance and we waited there for thirty minutes. Then they transfer you to another line that is high in security so no one can bud the line which probably took another 5 minutes. So by this point it was basically four. They were fresh out of pagers so they entered our names in the system and said to come back in an hour for the pager. So we got to walk around and do some shopping. When we came back at five we got a pager and had to wait about 25 more minutes before the buzzer went off. By this time it was like 5:30 (I told you it was perfectly planned).\n\nThe service here was phenomenal we had a great waitress named Lani and she was very receptive she always made sure we had bread. At one point I started to feel cold and put my jacket around my shoulders she popped by and asked if I wanted some hot water. We ordered the Thai lettuce wraps as an appetizer they are pricey but I would say could be easily eaten as a meal if your not super hungry. The wraps were really fresh and delicious. I would say a perfect replica of the buffalo factory. When we finished we waited quite a while for our food but again our amazingly receptive waitress noticed and pushed our order in again and it came within ten minutes. I ordered the Cajun chicken little S and it was probably enough food to feed three small children. Needless to say I couldn't finish it all. It came with a mountain of chicken some corn succotash and mashed potatoes with two different dipping sauces. My boyfriend ordered the factory burrito and again was a meal he couldn't finish. We also ordered a slice of cheesecake to go home. Everything was super delicious and affordable! The meal came up to $69 or so (without tip) for two of us to share an app and dessert with mains we couldn't even finish. \n\nIt was a great night with great service.

Overall, I think this place is super overhyped, but that doesn't mean it wasn't amazingly delicious!!\n\nI want to start off by saying that the portions are humongous! With my group, we all paired up with someone and ordered 1 main and 1 cheesecake. Prices are quite high but honestly, for the experience, I think it is kind of worth it. Definitely not a restaurant you would go to consistently, but for an amazing treat, I would for sure recommend. \n\nI ordered the Alfredo with Chicken and it was delicious! If i'm being super critical, I would say that the noodles are a bit too al dente and the chicken is a bit dry. Pretty plain meal to be honest, and very expensive. \n\nHad the celebration cheesecake and red velvet cheesecake. Humongous!!! Good ratios with cheesecake, cake and icing. \n\nHad the fried macaroni and cheese as an appetizer and lemme tell u guys. It was 4 small balls. LOL. 4 balls for $20. BUT I GOTTA SAY THOSE WERE SOME SUPER DELICIOUS BALLS GUYS!! Will definitely try to burger topped with fried macaroni and cheese next time. \n\nSO KEY POINTS :\n- not that affordable\n- big portions\n- good for sharing\n- awesome atmosphere and overall experience","FETTUCCINI ALFREDO,+

I went during their pre-opening and we ordered a bunch of things to try. \n\n1) Fried Calamari - this was good, I'm not a fan of seafood, but my friends loved it! \n2) Four cheese pasta - this was amazing!! The sauce was rich and creamy, but it wasn't overwhelmingly cheesy. I liked that the tomato sauce was sweet. Overall, this had great flavour. I would definitely recommend this, and I'd order it again. \n3) Louisiana chicken Cajun pasta - didn't try this myself, but my friend loved it! \n4) Shrimp platter - this was large enough to share with everyone as well! \n5) Tempura fish tacos - you get four tacos, and it's a great entree to share \n6) strawberry lemonade - this tasted soooo good and the glass was HUGE. FYI - it's on the sweet side \n7) Hershey cheesecake - this was AMAZING. If you love chocolate, get this! It's really rich and creamy, and you have to share it because it's huge. \n8) tuxedo cheesecake - this was really good too, and was lighter and tasted more like a mousse. \n\nKeep in mind: the portion sizes for everything are HUGE. You can share the mains with 2-3 people, or just take your leftovers home. So for the price, you're definitely getting your moneys worth. \n\nOverall: I'd recommend this place! There's so many options to try (over 250) and if you go with friends, you're all able to order whatever you like!","FRIED CALAMARI,+

The manager was apologetic and though I didn't pay monetarily for my meal,  I'll pay physically.","FOUR CHEESE PASTA"",-",,1,ZJN_aYPcnK0zJ_es_l0yxA,8,1,1/1,

Today in honor of national cheesecake day we decided to dine here for date night.  I had the pear and endive salad from their low calorie menu. It is not on the regular menu,  I allowed for a side of balsamic dressing as the low cal version is tasty but needed a tad more.  I'm not a drown your salad type of salad eater but adding a spoonful more didn't hurt anything, the salad was fantastic.  My hubby had the Imperial chicken dinner with white rice and fried shrimp.  The chicken was delictible it melted in my mouth.  Because we were going to get cheesecake we didn't order or normal appetizer which is the avocado egg rolls.  If you ever want something off the chart order some of these and you will be happy you did.  The new location was convenient to shopping and parking.  The soda  machine was out so we ordered water with lemon it was very good not that normal yuck restaurant water..  We got the cheesecakes to go and we are super stuffed.  Oh yeah please request James as your waiter, he was amazing and we were so impressed with his service and suggestions.  He made our meal even more enjoyable we will be back.",,,5,nYbLdMOWQnP8cDYIEp5NAA,8,1,0/3,

Come with a small medley of carrots and string beans with a strong zesty orange flavor throughout.\n\nProtip: don't go so hard on the bread basket, the entree portions are very generous and filling.","ORANGE CHICKEN,+",,4,o5o4lNPxZmGpgTGLTdIRqQ,8,1,1/1,

I had the steak medallions and also the BBQ chicken salad. The medallions where booked to a perfect medium rare and seasoned perfectly, the salad was huge and more than enough for two. Since it was a practice run our server was immensely nervous. We waited a while, but thankfully I had time to spare. The food did take a little while to get to us , but that can be expected in a practice service. All in all our server was attentive and pleasant. For a hundred dollar tab on them all I can say is thank you Cheesecake  Factory!","GRILLED STEAK MEDALLIONS,+",,4,Gg-sbLdsbSPEt5mbOlgejg,"2,8",1,1/2,

But I ordered a Factory Combo for $22.95 which I thought was a great deal for the Herb Crusted Salmon, Mashed Potatoes, and a Shrimp Scampi... the kind with the noodles. This should have been called ""Breaded Shrimp and Cream Sauce."" \n\nAnyways the mashed potatoes were good but I wanted gravy. The Herb Crusted Salmon was alright. I didn\'t really like the crust, a bit too bitter for my taste. The breaded shrimp was good and the cream sauce was fine. I really hated the sauce that came underneath my salmon and asparagus, I\'m so very glad that they put the asparagus between my salmon and the sauce so that it wasn\'t already touching and I was able to save it. I love asparagus and mine were ruined. :(\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Mushroom Swiss Burger, it was fine. He asked for it to be cooked medium rare and it was quite well done. \n\nWe ordered Chicken Samosas for our appetizer and I thought the cilantro dipping sauce was quite wonderful. I thought the samosas were pretty good.\n\nThe star of the show was... \n\nThe complimentary wheat bread!! Omg. It was soooo amazing. It was so warm, nice and toasty... it melted in my mouth, no butter neeeded. It was sweet and just so so amazing. I ate one whole piece and half of the second piece. I wanted to eat it all but of course I had to share, lol and I didn\'t want to ruin my appetite!\n\nOf cooourse we had to order a cheesecake since we were at The CHEESECAKE Factory! There were so many to choose from I wanted to try em all but we both only had enough room in our bellies to only share one! \n\nAfter a long time of trying to decide we chose the Turtle Pecan Cheesecake, it had a yummy brownie crust but not enough pecans. We took off the big chocolate mousse thing, it was better without it.\n\nWe needed to check out Cheesecake Factory since everyone loves this place but we just weren\'t really big fans! The food was just mediocre at best and the service was slooooow.","HERB CRUSTED FILET OF SALMON,

This place has nailed it.  As far as I'm concerned.  I've visited different locations with this order.  Not sure if it's because they are dairly new, at the time of this post?

Both breads were burned and very hard like they were stale. The steak was very chewy. Stay away in regards to the food. Def not worth the money.,,,1,62T_Sk_QFyNYySSpcCxddQ,8,,,
