But, don't set high expectations on the food. Alternatively, if you're told to wait a few hours it'd be faster to drive to Walden Galleria mall in Buffalo to eat at the Cheesecake Factory location there! \n\nTip: I've been told you can ask to sit at the bar to get seated more quickly. \n\nAnother tip: if you REALLY want to go, pick a weekday and go between 2-3pm when it's slowest (even then you'll have to queue).","CHEESEBURGER SPRING ROLLS,-

We were told there was nothing they could do and had to wait another 20 min. before being seated.  We asked if there were any birthday freebies because we were celebrating a birthday, and the waitress stated, ""We get like 45 birthdays a day; we\'d go broke if we gave something for free for birthdays.""  Seriously?  Not even a \'Happy Birthday\' from the waitress!  When asked if the fish tacos can be made half half (2 fried/2 grilled), she said \'No.\'  What kind of customer service is this?!  Also, when you ask for medium rare steak, they will bring you a well-done steak, so ask for blue/really rare steak if you want medium rare.  Definitely not worth the wait.

Both portion were actually smaller than we thought but it did fill up. \nThe tuna tartare has a balanced flavours of soy and ginger, the avocado chunk at the base separately from the fish make the dish presentable. The chips were a bit too oily. \nThe crab cake bites came with 6 pieces, mayo and lemon wedge on the side. I Expected it to be more crunchy.  theres a decent amount of crab in the little bites which is worth it. \nJambalaya pasta with shrimp and chicken came in huge portion with a mixed of regular pasta and spinach pasta. I like my pasta more al dente tho. Pasta wasn't rinse thoroughly so it was clumped a bit. Sauce was well seasoned, no complaints. \nAlmond crusted salmon salad served with kale, quinoa, dried cranberry and dressed in light sweetened balsamic. Salmon skin is crispy and the crusted is not too heavy which makes the dish overall not bad \nTiramisu cheesecake is amazing. The cheesecake part is not dense, more of a mouse texture which makes it light and not so rich to indulge the whole thing.

It was 3 huge lightly battered and fried chicken breasts with a lemon sauce, mashed potatoes and asparagus. There was enough food for two!

I have been to the Cheesecake Factory in Buffalo multiple times so I had high standards for my meal.\n\nIn order to get seated at this restaurant you need to be strategic. We arrived at Yorkdale at around 3:20 and immediately we joined the line for a pager. The line was past the Victoria secret entrance and we waited there for thirty minutes. Then they transfer you to another line that is high in security so no one can bud the line which probably took another 5 minutes. So by this point it was basically four. They were fresh out of pagers so they entered our names in the system and said to come back in an hour for the pager. So we got to walk around and do some shopping. When we came back at five we got a pager and had to wait about 25 more minutes before the buzzer went off. By this time it was like 5:30 (I told you it was perfectly planned).\n\nThe service here was phenomenal we had a great waitress named Lani and she was very receptive she always made sure we had bread. At one point I started to feel cold and put my jacket around my shoulders she popped by and asked if I wanted some hot water. We ordered the Thai lettuce wraps as an appetizer they are pricey but I would say could be easily eaten as a meal if your not super hungry. The wraps were really fresh and delicious. I would say a perfect replica of the buffalo factory. When we finished we waited quite a while for our food but again our amazingly receptive waitress noticed and pushed our order in again and it came within ten minutes. I ordered the Cajun chicken little S and it was probably enough food to feed three small children. Needless to say I couldn't finish it all. It came with a mountain of chicken some corn succotash and mashed potatoes with two different dipping sauces. My boyfriend ordered the factory burrito and again was a meal he couldn't finish. We also ordered a slice of cheesecake to go home. Everything was super delicious and affordable! The meal came up to $69 or so (without tip) for two of us to share an app and dessert with mains we couldn't even finish. \n\nIt was a great night with great service.

You can find better at Yorkville. \n\nThe Cheesecake Factory has ""American"" written all over it. The portion size is on the morbidly obese side. Anyone who\'s goal is to ruin their body with fried chicken between monster waffles with maple syrup and hollandaise sauce would love this place.\nI had the ""best"" French Toast (see photo). Believe me, it wasn\'t ""the best"". The best French toast was at a B&B up north years ago. Compared to all the other American portion sizes that is served at The Cheesecake Factory, the French toast must have been the smallest. They basically searched my the same bread that was delivered to my table but cut larger and dipped in batter. So basically, I ate eight pieces of the same bread for breakfast. \nMy wife had the plain pancakes. Thank Jesus the nice waitress allowed her to order the kids size. Their is no way she would have finished the fat American size! She took one bite an said ""That\'s enough. This is just garbage!""\nI tried some and realized that I can taste the starch, so much so, that it coated my mouth and can feel the stuff all over my tongue and teeth! Disgusting!\n\nThe price was outrageous for the quality of food. The price for portion size is ok. But quality.... uh.. not so much. \n\nThe Pickle Barrel is right beside this fat farm and the food is much better!\n\nThat was the first and last time I\'m going to the Cheesecake Factory!\n\nThe only saving grace was that I was not with all those other mindless ""zombies"" lining up for two hours. I arrived with my wife at 10am and was seated immediately.\nI would have been pissed if I was actually stupid enough to lineup for two hours for the meal I just ordered. \n\nIt made me sick!","EGGS BENEDICT WITH CANADIAN BACON AND HOLLANDAISE,+

Food was sooooo disappointing.  I ordered the New York steak, asked mild well and got raw w/ blood running on the plate and the steak was so tough and seasoning was so salty, only good part was mashed potatoe and green beans. I paid $29.99. Service was so horrible, our waitress was condescending and rude when my friend asked for a small glass for her coke drink and she rolled her eyes.

We got there at about 11 am and the wait wasn't too bad - 30 minutes. If it was any longer, I wouldn't have waited. \n\nThe actual restaurant is quite bright and big and very similar to what it looks like in the US locations. \n\nI ordered off the brunch menu, which is only available on Saturdays and Sundays.  I ordered the fried chicken and waffles which turned out to be quite yummy. I enjoyed the\ncombination of the sweet maple butter syrup and waffles and the savoury breaded fried chicken and poached eggs. Everything was cooked the way that it should be and was thoroughly enjoyed. I was worried that the Toronto location would not be the same as the US locations - but everything was comparable. \n\nI was so full that I had to order a slice of vanilla bean cheesecake to go. That too was very yummy. \n\nOverall, I had a positive experience at the Cheesecake Factory and I look forward to returning and trying other dishes.","FRIED CHICKEN AND WAFFLES,+

When our buzzer finally went off we were told to wait again in a line til our name was called, what was the point of taking the buzzer then??? \n\nWe ordered the following: \n1. Taquitos - these were surprisingly delicious \n2. Club sandwich - also good, but it\'s not a complicated dish \n3. Chicken and waffle Benedict - the waffle was soggy, and the hollandaise was just cream. There was no element of citrus or extraordinary flavour \n4. Monte Christo - the bread was soggy ( I mean wet and heavy), the inside was fine I guess, some parts had HUGE slices of omelette while others had none. One section of sandwich had no bottom bread. \n\nOverall the food wasn\'t amazing and we were full because the portions are very ""American"" sized but not satisfied - I think next time we will  not choose any of the brunch items \n\nI got a piece of turtle cheesecake to bring home since I was too full to try it there, it was good but a little expensive for $10 a slice. \n\nThe service is alright, our waitress showed up every so often to check on us or bring us something but nothing outstanding. \n\nI\'d go back for lunch or dinner maybe. I\'ve eaten at a few in the states and the pasta and mains are good, so will probably try that.","CHICKEN TAQUITOS,+

 was good, but a little too greasy.  For an entree, I ordered fish tacos, tortillas were very greasy and I had to send the dish back.  The second time they forgot to hold the cream, so I had to send my dish back again.  Coming from Los Angeles, I eat 
fish tacos
 all the time but these were just very bland.  I make them better at home.  I've had these before at another location and they were great, which is why I chose to order them.  By the time I finally got my food, I was already full from the appetizer and bread, so I just took them home.  If I knew I was taking a dish to go, fish tacos would be my last choice, since tortillas are obviously going to get soggy.\n\nMy husband had to send his 
fettucine alfredo
 back because the pasta was all clumped together.  It's like they overcooked it, then left it sitting without the sauce so it all stuck together.  For $19 for pasta and chicken, that's just ridiculous.  The kitchen staff needs to raise their standards for the prices they charge.    \n\nI've never had a problem at other Cheesecake Factory locations, but this one was definitely sub-par, with the exception of our waitress.  She was terrific.  Overall, an experience I wouldn't want to repeat.  I'll probably stay away from Cheesecake Factory for awhile.  Waste of money.",2,R_5HabKNeHB7GS5m5pkArg,4,1,2/3,

Everything I tried this last time was too little or too much. The beet and goat cheese salad. Beets were over cooked and smushy. I've never had smushy beets. They were also too salty. Too few pieces of pecans and goat cheese. The dressing had too much vinegar and too little oil. I ordered the steak medallion instead of the steak Diane off the skinnylicious menu. The serving was too small and again too too much salt. I was done after two bites. I tried my daughters buffalo chicken appetizer. Again too salty. She had a side of the buffalo sauce. Guess what too salty. My strawberry lemonade that I always get several refills was too sweet. I don't know what's going on with this location but I am not in too much a rush to go back.

Service is decent. They can be a bit slow when they're super busy and being in the outlet, they're usually busy. However, I've never had major problems with the service.

It is located out on the fashion outlet shops off the 15 freeway, North, Charleston B. It is a high end restaurant that serves great quality food with excellent service, expect to be thrilled if you have never been here.\n\n Outside, there are plenty of surrounding shops for people to shop for clothes, accessories and other various products. The location is located near a corner street. You cant miss it.\n\n Inside, it is noisy during peak hours at about 3-6pm on a weekend. There are bathrooms located in the back and no free wifi. The decoration is like any other cheesecake factory: a yellow tinted wall with various ceiling lights. There is a cheesecake bar for people to order cheesecake at the entrance. There is a bar for alcoholic drinks as well. There are many booths and regular tables/chairs scattered all over. I have been here in the afternoon and at night. It is the same noisy environment.\n\n Service: very good. Me and my family member were seated in less than 3 minutes. Our server was great, fast and efficient. He had a good personality and gave us our drinks before 3 minutes. Our meal came in about 10-15 minutes with a busy crowd. The bread they give you for convenience is warm. There are two types: sourdough and a whole grain bread. \n\n The prices: pretty moderate. Most of the entrees on the menu are above $10 and can go up to around $50 for their more expensive specialty items. I personally enjoyed the chicken madeira. It is their most popular chicken dish. However, I order other items on their skinnylicious menu. It is worth a look if you are wanting to cut pounds. \n\n Overall, it is a good experience. The food is worth what you pay for. The environment can be noisy, service is on point and the cheesecake selections are outstanding.

Now at this point, people  would dock a star or two regarding service,  but upon returning, Wifey asked politely ""Having a rough day?""\n\nOur waitress stepped back with a big sigh and apologized explaining the start of her day with a huge  power outage, EDC traffic, getting the kids ready, and getting ready for work all at the same time, so finding this out, we kinda sympathized with her and assured her that the worst part of her day was over, and whaddayouknow? Her demeanor did a 180...some people just need some positive reinforcement ya know?  Drinks were refilled, checked up on us periodically, and even the manager came by and was apologetic when she saw our food hadn\'t arrived yet!?

Took us maybe 5-8 minutes to find parking and we walked across the street from the parking garage to the restaurant. The restaurant has valet too so if you prefer not to deal with the parking, I highly advise. The front entrance to the restaurant is off of the street side across from the garage. You can also enter from another door that is deeper inside the mall, but then you have to walk through the dining room to get to the hostess area at the front. \n\nFor appetizers, the family and I ordered the Fried Mac and Cheese balls (delicious) and an assortment of varied spring rolls which were also very good. \n \nI ordered Evelyn's Famous Pasta. As to be expected, the portion size was huge! Everything in the dish tasted fresh and not overly cooked. The broccoli had a bit of crispness left to it and the mushrooms weren't soggy!

Why?  Dunno - just haven't, sue me.  Well, this location is in the Vegas Premium outlet center and after losing my mind in Michael Kors and other stores, it was time to eat and get out before I had to get a 2nd mortgage on my house to support my shopping habit.  \n\nAnyhoo - the atmosphere is nice, decor is great - the low marks I give this are for the 1) service and 2) regular food.  I have been to the sister spot, Grand Lux and GL seems to be better to me.  As far as service, our waiter was SLOW and had attitude.  It took forever to just get water, he forgot to bring bread to our table and when I told him one of the things I wanted was for to-go he got snippy with a 'you should have said that first' - UM, excuse me?  Anyway, the salad I ordered to eat there was over chopped - that may be weird to say but I like to see whole leaves in my salad - this one was over chopped like shredded lettuce in the store.  But it tasted good.  My friend ordered these buffalo chicken tenders that for some reason had the buffalo sauce on the inside - nah - I gotta skip that in the future, that's just not right to do to chicken. \n\nBUT - the Turkey burger is BAE!!!  That tasty somenother gave me LIFE!!!!!  The caramelized onions on it are the thing dreams and rainbows are made of...... mind you I ate this later on in the day in my hotel room after several rounds of drinks but trust me, my taste buds know good burgers even if they are reheated. \n\nThere is location near my house and I intend on stopping in to grab some cheesecake (the one thing I did NOT do on this visit) - so we'll see if I feel better about them then.

The training was extensive and the expectations from our managers were high. If I provided service like the service we receive when we go, I would be fired. \n\nToday was no exception. We went because we had a gift card. Even though the last few times (at other locations), the experience has been similar. Our server was slow, completely uninterested and lackadaisical. It started out semi fine, but turned into sitting and waiting for forever for everything with empty drinks. It's so weird to me to walk by a table over and over and see (or not see) that the drinks are completely empty and never think to refill. I'm allllll for tipping and tipping well, but isn't that what I'm tipping for?! To have a decent experience and be able to have a sip of water during the meal?! We looked around throughout our time there, and all of the server's tables needed their drinks filled, orders taken or food boxed up. But he was no where to be found. \n\nWe ordered the tuna poke entree. The presentation was beautiful as always. But the rice was dry (and wayyyyy too much of it), there was verryyyyyy little siracha aioli, and it was really bland over all. To give an example how bland- I shared it with my 9 month old baby. Especially for $15.95. I could get a delicious sushi burrito bowl with good quality fish and amazing toppings and fresh rice for $9 at a lot of places in Vegas now!\n\nWe also ordered the Shrimp with angel hair which was good and pasta cooked well and the crispy chicken costoletta. That was yummy too and came out with the side of sauce my husband had asked for. \n\nWe have such special memories of the Cheesecake Factory because of our history there.  We opened and worked in so many of the stores. It's such a disappointment to go and get such poor service when you know it's really not that hard and you can make good money when you provide a good experience. So we've gone back for the history. But its the service that usually makes you walk out feeling like you just wasted your money and time :(","TUNA POKE,-

Our server was great, but I honestly cannot remember his name :( He was asian, wore glasses and I think his name could have been Han or something like that. \n\nFood was good, everyone order something different. \nI had their combination plate with my favorite thing ever, herb crusted salmon. Came with a creamy lemon sauce, asparagus and mashed potatoes. For the second thing I got their steak diane. I forgot how it tasted and I was craving mushrooms so decided to get it. Let's just say that I did not enjoy it, as I thought I would. \nWe had some buffalo chicken strips that were really good. \nAnd my boyfriend had their jambalaya with shrimp, sausage and not sure what else but it was tasty. Packed with a lot of flavor. Only downfall was that they had ran out of white rice, so they gave him brown rice. \nFor dessert we had the red velvet cheesecake....eh I do not like red velvet so I am not even going to review this dessert. All I can say is, it was a huge slice. \n\nAs we were finishing dinner, they brought out a little ice cream sundae for my mom, as they sang Happy Birthday.

Bartender was not friendly seemed to be inconvenienced that we sat down at the bar to eat. The lady who brought our bread was nice but the bread was burned. My husband enjoyed his turkey burger but my shrimp pasta was not good at all the shrimp was very rubbery and overcooked and the asparagus was not very good and limp. Bartender never came back to ask how our food was or I would have politely told him that I did not like my entree which he should have known as I did not finish it. He must have been in a rush to get us out of the bar as he already presented us our bill before we even got our entree in a glass cup in front of us!!! At the end of the meal my water glass was empty and did not even ask to refill it therefore we just paid the check and left. It is very unfortunate for the money I spent on our lunch to not only be satisfied with the food but also the service. Lastly we sat at the end of the bar by the well or the servers pick up the drinks and unfortunately it was surrounded by fruit flies as I kept swatting them away from our area of the bar.

(Believe me, I've tried.)\n\nSince we were there during happy hour, we decided to share the Spicy Ahi Tuna Tempura Roll and she wanted the HH caesar salad.  The ahi tuna roll and the salad came out fairly quick, and no wonder, since the roll only consisted of four tiny pieces!  We were hungry, and the pieces were so diminutive, that I didn't even get a chance to take a photo of the dish!  It was very tasty, but certainly not substantial, so I took another look at the HH menu and settled on the hummus.  While waiting for it to arrive, Mom and I shared the nicely-sized caesar salad, which was crisp-fresh and not overly-dressed.  \n\nWe decided to hold off on the salad for awhile, so as not to fill ourselves up on it.  The hummus and grilled pita bread arrivedl, and they too were flavorful; We couldn't get enough!  While we normally would've stuck w/ the happy hour menu, Mom had caught sight of a neighboring table's two platters and admired one of them, so I decided to order not the one she thought looked appetizing (the menu description turned her off), but what I had originally wanted to order instead of the hummus plate- a chicken pasta dish from the seasonal menu.  Two chicken breasts, pounded thin, battered, then fried, sitting atop of spaghetti w/ a basil-pesto cream sauce.  On top of the chicken were slices of prosciutto and dressed arugula greens sprinkled w/ grated parmesan.  This dish tasted fabulous, and the different textures it offered made me swoon!  (I knew Mom enjoyed it as well, for she repeated at least two times how great the food was!)  However, I knew that the greasiness of this dish would haunt me after.  Still, a great savory dish, and next time, I'll just skip the happy hour menu (save the caesar salad, that's a must!) and order from the dinner menu, instead.\n\nGreat service, as always, although I just remembered that the honey wheat bread I had asked for arrived stale.  Funny that the server had even bothered to serve it, as she did warn us that it wasn't as fresh as it could be and that a new batch was baking in the oven.

The Margarita, however, was terrible- tasted purely of margarita mix & nothing else; pretty much had to force it down- no sense in wasting a $10 drink.

There was absolutely no flavor, the shrimp was overcooked & extremely chewy and the rice was still hard. I took a few bites and couldn\'t force anymore down. It was gross. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Shrimp with Angel Hair. The description talks about all this lemon, garlic flavor with some marinara sauce. This ""meal"" had absolutely no flavoring. It seemed like they made the pasta, threw a hefty helping of bruschetta tomatoes on top and threw on 5 pieces of overcooked shrimp to it & charged us $17.95. There was no sauce, no lemon/herb flavor.
