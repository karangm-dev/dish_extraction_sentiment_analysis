I also always order the same meal, I know boring , to me it's great. I order the spicy chicken chipotle pasta, tonight without saying anything there was a substitution made for the type of noodles that is used for the pasta. I would not have ordered from that location if I knew this was going to happen, it may sound petty but it's not what I ordered. All other services at this location are perfect and is normally my choice of the 4 to go to, easy curbside pick up in and out in minutes and everyone is friendly, just wish they would have told me about a change."," ""SPICY CHICKEN CHIPOTLE PASTA"",+",,3,ooFlN63WzuPgRwIKZTPdrw,11,1,1/1,

Unfortunately this location did not.\n\nMy boyfriend and I went after a lovely show at the Smith Center and it let out about 10pm. We wanted to go eat somewhere nice and conveniently close. As we love our Cheesecake Factory at Green Valley Ranch, we decided to try this location based on our great experiences with the other locations.\n\nGreat factor was that it was open till 12am but downside is that even though there were not so many people on a Friday night, the service was very slow. We usually get our favorites, Avocado Spring Rolls, Bistro Shrimp Pasta and Rib Eye Steak. \n\nThe Spring rolls were delicious as is the sauce which is easily devoured! But the Bistro Shrimp pasta was really spicy! Now this is supposed to be a general garlic and wine sauce with no spicyiness at all. It had way too much red chili peppers! My mouth was on fire! \n\nThe steak was burned but my boyfriend ate it anyways since he was hungry.\n\nWhen the server asked about the meals I let him know of the issues but all we got was a 'Sorry' (It wasn't his fault for the food though) and only 5% off the bill.\n\nIf you want the traditional Cheesecake Factory yumminess, don't go to this location as it lacks the quality and taste.","BISTRO SHRIMP PASTA,-

So, I ordered their Louisiana Chicken Pasta in hopes that it will satisfy my cravings. I ordered the food to go, and half way through eating it, I found a hair on my food. Mind you, I am a female with long brown hair, and this strand that I found was a short, thick, black hair. Definitely not mine! It made me gag, and I was sooo disappointed. I'm not one to write a bad review on Yelp, but I was just really disappointed this happened.","LOUISIANA CHICKEN PASTA,-",,1,oUROKgLd3HVKwaMWVRDZQQ,11,,,
